# Introduction

Banshee is a component library for Vue which seeks to only provide the JavaScript functionality and leaves the HTML markup and styling to you. It ships with no CSS and minimal to no HTML in all components.

Banshee allows you to focus on building custom applications the way you want them to look without having to conform to another library's design specs. Gain complete control on how you build Vue applications.

## Why Banshee?

Banshee aims to provide developers with a quick of way creating components that specifically match your application's needs. It takes ownership of the JavaScript functionality of components and accessibility so you can focus on building your own components and how they look and feel.

You may find Banshee useful when porting legacy apps to Vue. Since Banshee ships with no CSS you can easily integrate your own CSS into Banshee components. Whether your current application uses custom CSS, Bootstrap, Foundation, SemanticUI, or another CSS framework Banshee will easily integrate with them all.

## Coming in 1.0

Banshee is currently in Beta and is missing some components and features. Here are the some of the things that are planned for 1.0:

- Portal component
- Audio / Video component
- Tree component
- Pagination component
- Calendar / Datepicker component
- Color picker component
- Extensive cookbook with examples composing multiple banshee components to build other more complex components (autocomplete, data table, etc.)
